All remaining bugs are listed [here](https://github.com/adepreis/BzzML/issues).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purpose.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the project :

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads)
	- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) library
	- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) library
	- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) library
	<!--
	- [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow) library 
	??? -->

### Running

Here are some instructions on how to get the development env running.

First, clone this repository with the following command :

	`git clone https://github.com/adepreis/BzzML`

Then, after moving into the `/BzzML` folder just created, start Jupyter using :

	$ jupyter notebook

or 

	> jupyter-notebook.exe

if you are a Windows user.

This should open up your browser (if it doesn't, visit [127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree)), and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory.

**If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks**, the most recent [release](https://github.com/adepreis/BzzML/releases) includes the corresponding `.py` files.

## Dataset

In the `/data` folder, you can find ... <!-- are we allowed to share dataset or should we ask the user to download it by itself ? (requires a Kaggle account) --> ?

The used image dataset has been shared by [Ivan Felipe Rodriguez](kaggle.com/ivanfel) under _Honey Bee pollen_ [kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/ivanfel/honey-bee-pollen) in the framework of the following publication :
